Credit: Scammer and Bob_74 on FiveM forums for original speedo code and resources

Simple speedometer resource for fivem

1.) Drop it in your server resource folder and rename it to gui_speedometer

2.) Use your server.cfg or console to start it "start gui_speedometer"

Edit the config.lua to configure colors and hide keybind

Added Toggleable autohide
Do note: if autohide is enabled it cancels out the hotkey hide may change this later so that the hot key overrides autohide.
